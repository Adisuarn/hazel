# Hazel—Clubs Data Processing Framework

Use Hazel to deal with complex data without hustle.

## Prerequisite
<p>
Current built-in data source is Firebase Firestore. To establish the connection <b>.env</b> is required with the format as shown below.
</p>

### .env File

```dotenv
FCERT_CLIENT_EMAIL=
FCERT_PROJECT_ID=
FCERT_PRIVATE_KEY=
```

### Important note
<p>
Default exported data directory is ./resource, which git ignored by default. To avoid accidentally exposing any data, this directory should not be added to the public repository.
</p>
